<p style= "color:rgb(240,229,229);text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 20px">I chose to create a web-page discussing my favorite hobby. Playing sports and staying active has been apart of my life since I was big enough to participate in said activities. 
I believe physical activity has a lot more mental benefits than people realize and that is one of the biggest reasons I've stayed so interested and commited to these sports. The proudest hobby related accomplishment is probably getting third in the state tournament!
Adivce I would give someone that is trying to fit in more exercise in their life would be to start small, maybe going on short walks or finding an activity that you really enjoy!</p>

  <p style ="color: rgb(240,229,229);text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 15px">Background- Growing up, my dad was a pro at a golf course and would always take my sister and I to the range after hours to hit balls. I remember hitting with these little plastic clubs and barely getting it over the hill that was maybe 10 yards away. As we got older, we started competing in summer tournaments and were members of our high school team.

  <p style="color: rgb(240,229,229);text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 15px">Highschool- I played all four years of high school and loved every second of it. Our team was super close and got the chance to make some school history. Our high school had ever been to state as a team before and we were very thankful to walk out of that tournament with third place my senior year. </p>

  <p style= "color: rgb(240,229,229);text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 15px">College- I am a junior here at Lewis and I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to continue my golf career at this amazing institution. It is sad knowing I don’t have much time left playing the sport I love but it’s been an unforgettable experience.</p>

  <div id="volleyball" style ="color: rgb(240,229,229);font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 20px">Volleyball</div>
  <p style= "color: rgb(240,229,229);text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 15px">Background- I started playing volleyball in third grade because my school offered a small pee wee team. Growing up, I was always one of the taller kids in my class and that gave me a little advantage over the other 8 year olds.

  <p style = "color: rgb(240,229,229);text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 15px">Highschool- Because golf and volleyball are both fall sports, it was hard for me to juggle both at times but I managed to do so my first three years of high school. During my junior year season, I broke my ankle during a game, which also ended my golf season as well. After the injury, I realized that playing volleyball wasn’t worth the risk of not being able to play golf in college</p>

  <p id="basketball" style ="color: rgb(240,229,229);font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 20px">Basketball</p>
  <p style = "color: rgb(240,229,229);text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms; font-size: 15px">Overall, basketball wasn’t something that I was super passionate about, but more of something I did in the winter to stay busy and in shape. I’m not going to sit here and act like I was Lebron, but again my height gave me somewhat of an advantage. </p>
